# Drum Machine

See the project live: https://markdown-previewer-free-code-camp.netlify.app/

The App functionality is based on `user stories` from **freeCodeCamp**, you can check them out here: [Build a Drum Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine)

## Motivation
While building the app my goal was to practice following concepts/technologies:
* React, React Hooks
  * playing sounds
